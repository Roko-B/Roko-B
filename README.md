# Hello, My name is Roko Brlek
I am a highschool student currently studying in the 3rd grade mathematics branch of the gymnasium of **"Gimnazija Andrije Mohorovičića, Rijeka."** I have experience in front end and back end development, as well as more low level languages such as ` C ` . I was part of our school's Crobotics teams as a backend software engineer for a year. I have a passion for mathematics, and have informal experience with mathematical proofs. I utilize math in the IT field by using mathematical modeling to come up with solutions to problems or with optimizations to existing solutions.

## Projects I have worked on
- [Simulating ant colonies](https://github.com/Roko-B/Visualizing-the-simulation-of-ant-colonies) using a simple system of differential equations and visualizing the simulation in an interactive figure implemented in python using matplotlib.
- [Creating a html/css/js webpage](https://github.com/Roko-B/HTML-CSS-JS-school-project) on the theme of "techonologies of the future.[^1]"

[^1]: This project is written in Croatian.

## What I am looking for and how to contact me
I am looking for a part time summer job in the IT industry, for which I would be available throughout June and August.
